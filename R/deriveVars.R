#' Derive variables by transformation.
#'
#' \code{deriveVars} produces derived variables from explanatory variables by
#' the following transformation types as described in Halvorsen et al. (2015):
#' L, M, D, HF, HR, T (for continuous EVs), and B (for categorical EVs). For
#' spline transformation types (HF, HR, T),  a subset of possible DVs is
#' selected by the criteria described in Halvorsen et al. (2015) p. 179.
