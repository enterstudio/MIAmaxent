\title{Select parsimonious sets of derived variables.}
\usage{
selectDV(rv, dv, alpha = 0.01, writedir = NULL, jarpath = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{rv}{Response variable vector. The RV should represent
presence/background data, coded as: 1/NA.}

\item{dv}{List of data frames, with each data frame containing DVs for a
given EV. E.g. output of \code{deriveVars}.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha-level used in F-test comparison of models.}

\item{writedir}{The directory to which Maxent files will be written during
subset selection of DVs. Defaults to the working directory.}

\item{jarpath}{The pathway to the maxent.jar executable jar file. If
unspecified, the function looks for the file in the writedir.}
}
\value{
List of data frames, with each data frame containing \emph{selected}
  DVs for a given EV. Dimensions: [[EV]] [N, <=DV].
}
\description{
For each explanatory variable, \code{selectDV} selects the parsimonious set
of derived variables which best explains variation in a given response
variable. The function uses a process of forward selection based on
comparison of nested models by the F-test.
}
\details{
If the derived variables were created using \code{\link{deriveVars}}, the
same response variable should be used in \code{selectDV}, as the deviation
and spline transformations produced by \code{deriveVars} are RV-specific.
