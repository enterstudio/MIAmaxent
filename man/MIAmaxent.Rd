\title{MIAmaxent: A modular, integrated approach to maximum entropy distribution
modeling}
\description{
Tools for training, selecting, and evaluating maximum entropy (and standard
logistic regression) distribution models. This package provides tools for
user-controlled transformation of explanatory variables,  selection of
variables by nested model comparison, and flexible model evaluation and
projection. It follows principles based on the maximum-likelihood
interpretation of maximum entropy modelling, and implements maximum entropy
models as infinitely-weighted logistic regressions.
}
\details{
The predecessor to this package is the MIA Toolbox, which is described in
detail in Mazzoni et al. (2015).

MIAmaxent is built around the highly popular Maximum Entropy distribution
modeling method (Phillips et al., 2006), but provides an alternative
methodology for training, selecting, and using models. The major advantage in
this alternative methodology is greater user control -- in variable
transformations, in variable selection, and in model output. Comparisons also
suggest that this methodology results in simpler models with equally good
predictive ability, and reduces the risk of overfitting (Halvorsen et al.,
2016).
