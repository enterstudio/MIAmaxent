\title{Read in data object from files.}
\usage{
readData(occurrence, contEV = NULL, catEV = NULL, maxbkg = 10000,
  PA = FALSE, XY = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{occurrence}{Full pathway of the '.csv' file of occurrence data. The
first column of the CSV should code occurrence (see Details), while the
second and third columns should contain X and Y coordinates corresponding
to the ASCII raster coordinate system. The first row is read as a header
row.}

\item{contEV}{Pathway to a directory containing continuous environmental
variables in '.asc' file format.}

\item{catEV}{Pathway to a directory containing categorical environmental
variables in '.asc' file format.}

\item{maxbkg}{Integer. Maximum number of grid cells randomly selected as
unknown background points for the response variable. Default is 10,000.
Irrelevant for presence/absence data (\code{PA = TRUE}) and ignored for
presence-only data (\code{PA = FALSE}) if \code{occurrence} contains 'NA'
values.}

\item{PA}{Logical. Does \code{occurrence} represent presence/absence data?
This argument affects how the values in \code{occurrence} are interpreted,
and controls what type of data object is produced. See details.}

\item{XY}{Logical. Include XY coordinates in the output. May be useful for
spatial plotting. Note that coordinates included in the training data used
to build the model will be treated as explanatory variables.}
}
\value{
Data frame with the Response Variable (RV) in the first column, and
  Explanatory Variables (EVs) in subsequent columns. When \code{PA = FALSE},
  RV values are 1/NA, and when \code{PA = TRUE}, RV values are 1/0.

  With presence-only occurrence data, the returned output can be used as the
  \code{data} argument for \code{\link{plotFOP}}, \code{\link{deriveVars}},
  \code{\link{selectDVforEV}}, \code{\link{selectEV}}, and
  \code{\link{plotResp}}. With presence/absence occurrence data, the returned
  output can be used as the \code{data} argument for \code{\link{testAUC}}.
  Output from \code{readData} can also be used as the \code{data} argument
  for \code{\link{plotResp2}}, and \code{\link{projectModel}}, but for these
  functions the values of RV are irrelevant.

\description{
\code{readData} reads in occurrence data in CSV file format and environmental
data in ASCII raster file format and produces a data object which can be used
as the starting point for the functions in this package. This function is
intended to make reading in data easy for users familiar with the maxent.jar
program. It is emphasized that important considerations for data preparation
(e.g. cleaning, sampling bias removal, etc.) are not treated in this package
and must be dealt with separately!
}
\details{
When \code{occurrence} represents presence-only data (\code{PA = FALSE}), all
rows with values other than 'NA' in column 1 of the CSV file are treated as
presence locations. If column 1 contains any values of 'NA', these rows are
treated as the unknown background locations for the response variable. Thus,
'NA' can be used to specify a specific set of background locations if
desired. Otherwise background points are randomly selected from the full
extent of the raster cells which are not already included as presence
locations. Only cells which contain data for all environmental variables are
selected as background locations.

When \code{occurrence} represents presence/absence data (\code{PA = TRUE}),
rows with value '0' in column 1 of the CSV are treated as absence locations,
rows with value 'NA' are excluded, and all other rows are treated as
presences.

The names of the ASCII raster files are used as the names of the explanatory
variables, so these files should be uniquely named, and the names must not
contain spaces, underscores, or colons. Underscores and colons are reserved
to denote derived variables and interaction terms repectively.
\code{readData} automatically replaces underscores with hyphens.
