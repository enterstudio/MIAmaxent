\title{Read in data object from files.}
\usage{
readData(occurrence, contEV, catEV, maxbkg = 10000, PA = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{occurrence}{Full pathway of the '.csv' file of occurrence data. The
first column of the CSV should code occurrence (see Details), while the
second and third columns should contain X and Y coordinates cooresponding
to the ASCII raster coordinate system. The first row is read as a header
row.}

\item{contEV}{Pathway to a directory containing continuous environmental
variables in '.asc' file format.}

\item{catEV}{Pathway to a directory containing categorical environmental
variables in '.asc' file format.}

\item{maxbkg}{Integer. Maximum number of grid cells selected as unknown
background points for the response variable. Default is 10,000.}

\item{PA}{Logical. Does \code{occurrence} represent presence/absence data?
When \code{TRUE}, rows in \code{occurrence} with the value 0 in the first
column are treated as absences, and all others are treated as presences.}
}
\value{
Data frame with the Response Variable (RV) in the first column, and
  Explanatory Variables (EVs) in subsequent columns. When \code{PA = FALSE},
  RV values are 1/NA, and when \code{PA = TRUE}, RV values are 1/0.

  With presence-only occurrence data, the returned output can be used as the
  \code{data} argument for \code{\link{plotFOP}}, \code{\link{deriveVars}},
  \code{\link{selectDVforEV}}, \code{\link{selectEV}}, and
  \code{\link{plotResp}}. With presence/absence occurrence data, the returned
  output can be used as the \code{data} argument for \code{\link{testAUC}}.
  Output from \code{readData} can also be used as the \code{data} argument
  for \code{\link{plotResp2}}, and \code{\link{projectModel}}, but for these
  functions the values of RV are irrelevant.
}
\description{
\code{readData} reads in occurrence data in CSV format and environmental data
in ASCII raster format and produces a data object which can be used as the
starting point for the functions in this package. This function is intended
to make reading in data easy for users familiar with the maxent.jar program.
It is emphasized that important considerations for data preparation (e.g.
cleaning, sampling bias removal, etc.) are not treated in this package and
must be dealt with separately!
}
\details{
When \code{occurrence} represents presence-only data (\code{PA = FALSE}), all
rows are treated as presences, and the values in column 1 of the CSV are
irrelevant. Conversely, when \code{occurrence} represents presence/absence
data (\code{PA = TRUE}), rows with value 0 in column 1 of the CSV are treated
as absences, and all other rows are treated as presences.

For presence-only occurrence data, background points are randomly selected
from the full extent of the grid files, and may include presence locations.
Only cells which contain data for all variables are selected.

The names of the ASCII raster files are used as the names of the explanatory
variables, so these files should be uniquely named, and the names must not
contain spaces or colons.
