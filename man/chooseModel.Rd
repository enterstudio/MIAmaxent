\title{Trains a model containing the explanatory variables specified.}
\usage{
chooseModel(dvdata, formula)
}
\arguments{
\item{dvdata}{A list containing first the response variable, followed by data
frames of \emph{selected} derived variables for a given explanatory
variable (e.g. the first item in the list returned by
\code{\link{selectDVforEV}}).}

\item{formula}{A model formula (in the form y ~ x + ...) specifying the
independent terms to be included in the model. The item in \code{dvdata} is
still taken as the response variable, regardless of \code{formula}.}
}
\description{
\code{chooseModel} trains a model based on the formula provided. The formula
specifies which explanatory variables (EVs) -- and potentially first-order
interactions between these -- should be included in the model. Each EV can be
represented by 1 or more derived variables (see \code{\link{deriveVars}}).
The function may be employed to choose a model from the selection pathway of
\code{\link{selectEV}} other than the model selected under the provided alpha
value.
}
\details{
Explanatory variables should be uniquely named. Underscores ('_') and colons
(':') are reserved to denote derived variables and interaction terms
repectively, and \code{chooseModel} will replace these -- along with other
special characters -- with periods ('.').
